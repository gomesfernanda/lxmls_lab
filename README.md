# Lab for LxMLS 2018 - Lisbon Machine Learning School 2018

Here I'll practice the lab exercises for LxMLS 2018.

This is a repo based on [the original repo from the school](https://github.com/LxMLS/lxmls-toolkit).

I have a fork of it but this repo is to add the answers for the exercises and not their solutions.
